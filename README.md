# Detection of Interactions Software for High-throughput Analysis

An automated tool to detect and analyze yeast-based assays to learn more about transcriptional regulation in immune
responses and cancer. We are working for
[Anna Berenson](https://www.bu.edu/mcbb/profile/anna-berenson/) and [Prof. Fuxman Bass](https://www.fuxmanlab.com/).

The current version uses segmentation model trained on a dataset generated by my manual colony extraction algorithm. The dataset was generated by running different configuration of the manual algorithm and randomly sampling patches from the output images. I created a tool to either include or reject those random samples and populate the dataset.

## Instructions

#### This software is mainly for processing large batches of images on a high performance server like the SCC at BU.

### Requirements
The software requires a GPU to function properly. Setup CUDA toolkit before running the software.

#### Pip
- tensorflow
- segmentation_models
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy
- scikit_learn





### Folder Structure

1. Create a root folder that will contain all the experiments.
2. Each experiment should have their own folder containing all images and an excel file containing details about coordinates and transcription factor pairs.
3. Modify ```BATCH_SIZE``` in ```Pipeline.py```.
4. ```python D-HETY1H.py <path-to-root>```
5. The software will crawl all the subfolders and execute the processing pipeline if it does not contain the 'output' folder.
6. The output files will have the extension ```.dhy1h```. You will need to use <a href = "https://mahir1010.github.io/DHY1H-Viewer/">DHY1H Viewer</a> for visualizing the data.
