# Heterodimer-Y1H-Analysis
An automated tool to detect and analyze yeast-based assays to learn more about transcriptional regulation in immune responses and cancer. We are working for
[Anna Berenson](https://www.bu.edu/mcbb/profile/anna-berenson/) and [Prof. Fuxman Bass](https://www.fuxmanlab.com/).

The methodology is explained more in the [DY1H-Slide Deck.pdf](https://github.com/mahir1010/Heterodimer-Y1H-Analysis/blob/3f4fb20688b8a6ce9ea7bb8650551d4ccdfe8e71/DY1H-Slide%20Deck.pdf)
